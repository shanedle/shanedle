# Hello, World! 🌐
## I'm Shane Le – Crafting Code and Crushing Workouts 🖥️💪

I'm all about blending the precision of coding with the discipline of a good gym session. For me, every problem solved in code is like nailing a new personal best on the bench.

### About My Day-to-Day 📅

👨‍💻 **Front-End Developer:**
I treat my projects like my workouts: consistent, focused, and always pushing for better performance. React, TypeScript, and NodeJS are my go-to tools, and I'm all about creating experiences that users love.

🕹️ **Gamer & Gym Enthusiast:**
Away from the keyboard, I'm either racking up scores in the latest game or racking weights at the gym. Balance is key, and I apply that to both my leisure activities and my work.

🌟 **Keep It Simple:**
I like my code clean and my workouts efficient. It's about doing the basics well and building on a solid foundation.
